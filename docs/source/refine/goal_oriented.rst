Goal-oriented Metrics
=====================

Goal-oriented metrics are based on adjoint solutions which is a more target
adaptation metric focusing on a single cost function like lift or drag.
The goal-oriented metric objects need to be paired with simulation objects that
compute an adjoint solution (see :ref:`adjoint_simulations`).
